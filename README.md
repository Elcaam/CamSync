## File Retrieval System
This a personal project for a web-based, AI-enhanced file management developed 
to sort of explore concepts in system design including file indexing, retrieval algorithms, user UI/UX patterns.

## Goals:
- The main goal is to build an intelligent search interface that mimics ssd-like file storage
- The other main thing is to enable natural languages understanding and maybe voice based query
- The last but not leas is to apply ranking logic to return the most relevant files/documents

## Current Status (This project is still in its early phases)

            Completed Tasks:
            -----------------
- The front end (for now)
- Basic file repo layout: upload + search UI.

          Upcoming Tasks:
         ------------------
  - Backend integration
  - keyword based file search
  - AI/NLP query processing

  ## Tech stack
- Front End: HTML, CSS, JS
- Backend: Python, C++,...
- AI: maybe NLTK???
- File index: maybe Elastic Search????
- ETC
